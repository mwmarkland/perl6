Experiments with Perl6

This contains snippets and actual programs as I explore Perl6.

## Why Perl6?

1. Because I've always liked Perl5 but couldn't get into the OO piece of it.
2. Because Larry Wall has cool ideas.
3. Because I've never been into Python that much, although I've written a fair amount of it.
4. Something new.
